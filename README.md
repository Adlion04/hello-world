# hello-world
This is my very first git
Hey there, i am a freshman in coding. Here i want to share how i came to idea of learning coding.
Years ago, my brother,Arthur works as a Senior Software-Engineer at Yandex, told about his work , that was really interesting for me, he used Ubuntu at that time and showed some commands on it. It was so exciting to watch how he writes commands. From time to time, i tried to write something on my own, a month ago i was learning python on Sololearn, and created a new project. you need to write something that you want it to be written thousand times, that code didnt stop writing untill you stop it.I wrote "I love you , My Anonymous Princess" and the code wrote it thousand time again and again. I took a screenvideo and sent it to my friend(Eldona) she was surprised and this was another reason for continuing coding, because i love when my friends are surprised with things that i can do.
That's it , I guess.
